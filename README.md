Conducting multivariate analysis on Dell 

In this project, I practice using JMP to perform different techniques on Multivariate Analysis. 
Some of the often known multivariate techniques include - discriminant analysis, principal components, examining eigenvalues, scree plots and factor analysis. 

At the end, I provide a list of recommendations for the management to understand what could be used to improve sales at Dell.
